<div class="lists">
<ol type="1.">
<b><li>Applying to UF graduate school is a multi-step process.</li><br></b>
<ul><font size=3>
Start by exploring our more than 250 degree programs to determine the application requirements and if 
additional items, such as transcripts, portfolios or recommendation letters, are needed in your application. 
</font>
</ul><br>
<b><li>Review the UF Graduate School Admissions Brochure.</li><br></b>

<b><li>Are you ready to apply?</li><br></b>
<ul><font size=3>
Regardless of program, all graduate students apply using the UF graduate school application through CollegeNET. 
You will select your college and major within the application. Complete the application and pay the $30 non-refundable 
application fee. Review your application carefully before submission, as changes cannot be made once the application is submitted.<br><br>
If you are applying to more than one program, you must complete an application for each program and pay the non-refundable application fee.
</font>
</ul><br>
<b><li>Submit test scores.</li><br></b>
<ul><font size=3>
Official test scores must be sent to UF electronically by the testing agency.
<li>GRE</li>
<li>GMAT</li>
<li>Fundamentals of Engineering</li>
<li>Exemptions</li>
<li>Verifying Receipt of Scores</li>
</font>
</ul><br>
<b><li>Send your transcripts to the UF Office of Admissions.</li><br></b>
<ul><font size=3>
Applicants who receive an offer of admissions should arrange to have official transcripts sent 
to the UF Office of Admissions from each postsecondary institution attended. 
If you attended UF as your postsecondary institution, you do not have to order a transcript from the Office of the University Registrar.
<br><br>
Transcript updates can be found within your Application Status page. 
Transcripts uploaded or received by mail will display on the Application Checklist as Transcript - Under Review. 
</font>
</ul><br>
<b><li>Submit Resume or Curriculum Vitae.</li><br></b>
<ul><font size=3>
Pursuant to Florida Statute, your application 
requires inclusion of all post-high school education and employment, 
as well as information about ongoing international affiliations and research funding. 
</font>
</ul><br>
<b><li>Letters of Recommendation</li><br></b>
<ul><font size=3>
If the program of interest requires recommendation letters, these should be submitted electronically through the admissions application. 
You must request these recommendations prior to submitting your application. 
You cannot add or delete recommendations once your application has been submitted. 
</font>
</ul><br>
<b><li>Check Your Application Status</li><br></b>
<ul><font size=3>
You can check the receipt of materials by the Office of Admissions on the Check Status page. 
This page will only reflect information 
concerning materials forwarded directly to the Office of 
Admissions and does not include materials that are required to be sent directly to your academic unit.
<br><br>
Your UFID is unique to you and should be used in all email communication and any subsequent applications submitted. 
If you do not use your UFID in communications and submissions, it is 
difficult for us to match your test scores, transcripts, and financial aid information to your academic record.
